# Floating-Camera-Part
A ROBLOX creation used for camera manipulation

## Description
The **`Float.lua`** script provides an easy way to add subtle floating effects to any Roblox instance/part. By incorporating this script into your project, you can use it to create dynamic movements that simulate floating or hovering behavior. This behavior can then be used with camera manipulation.
