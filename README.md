# `Floating-Camera-Part`
`A ROBLOX creation used for camera manipulation`

## Overview
The **`Float.lua`** script provides an easy way to add subtle floating effects to any Roblox instance/part. By incorporating this script into your project, you can use it to create dynamic movements that simulate floating or hovering behavior. This behavior can then be used with camera manipulation.

## Set Up
- Download the **`FloatPart.rbxm`** file
- Open ROBLOX Studio
- Insert the file by going to File > Insert from file > path.to.floatPart.rbxm

Alternatively, you can download the **`FloatPart.rbxl`** and open the instance directly.
